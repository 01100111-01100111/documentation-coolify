# Database SSL
Database SSL in Coolify encrypts the communication between your applications and databases, ensuring that data remains secure. 

With automatic certificate binding and generation, this feature simplifies secure setup. It was first introduced in Coolify version **v4.0.0-beta.399**.



## Introduction
Database SSL adds an extra layer of security by encrypting data exchanged with your database. This guide covers:
- Enabling SSL mode for your database connections.
- Selecting the appropriate SSL mode based on your security needs.
- Managing the CA certificate that verifies database connections.


## 1. How to Enable Database SSL
To secure your database connection with SSL:

1. **Access Database Settings**  
   In your Coolify dashboard go to the general settings page of the database you want to secure.

2. **Enable SSL Mode**  
   Check the **Enable SSL** option to activate SSL for the database connection.

3. **Select the SSL Mode**  
   Choose the SSL mode from the dropdown menu. For example, select **verify-full** for maximum security.

::: warning **Note:** 

For some databases like PostgreSQL, SSL might already be enforced through the connection string. 

For others, such as Redis-based databases, enabling this setting is essential.
:::

Coolify automatically binds the generated certificates and keys to the required locations, so manual changes are only needed if you wish to use custom certificates.


## 2. SSL Modes Explained
Coolify supports several SSL modes, each providing a different level of security:

- **allow (insecure)**  
  This mode permits both encrypted and unencrypted connections. It does not enforce SSL, so if SSL fails, the connection will fall back to an unencrypted state. 
  
  This option is considered insecure because it allows unencrypted traffic.

- **prefer (secure)**  
  With this mode, Coolify will attempt to use SSL first. If an SSL connection is available, it will be used, otherwise, it will fall back to an unencrypted connection. 
  
  While this option prefers encryption, it doesn’t guarantee that every connection will be secured.

- **require (secure)**  
  This mode mandates that the connection must be encrypted. However, it does not perform any checks on the server certificate. 
  
  This means the connection is encrypted, but the identity of the server is not verified.

- **verify-ca (secure)**  
  This option goes a step further by encrypting the connection and verifying that the server's certificate is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). It does not check if the hostname matches the certificate. 
  
  This mode offers a balance between security and ease of setup.

- **verify-full (secure)**  
  This is the most secure mode. It not only encrypts the connection and verifies the certificate authority but also confirms that the server’s hostname matches the certificate. 
  
  This provides full assurance that you are connecting to the correct server, similar to the security level provided by Cloudflare Origin Certificate setups.

::: success Tip
For maximum security, **verify-full** is recommended.

## 3. CA SSL Certificate Management
Coolify manages the CA certificate automatically, ensuring that secure database connections are validated. 

In the dashboard, under **Servers > Proxy > Advanced**, you can see the following options:

- **CA SSL Certificate**: Displays the current CA certificate used.
- **Save Certificate**: Allows you to save a local copy of the certificate.
- **Regenerate Certificate**: Lets you generate a new CA certificate if needed.


### Recommended Configuration
For secure connections, mount the Coolify CA certificate into all containers that need to connect to your databases. The recommended bind mount is:

```
/data/coolify/ssl/coolify-ca.crt:/etc/ssl/certs/coolify-ca.crt:ro
```


## 4. Using a Custom CA Certificate
If you wish to use your own CA certificate instead of the one generated by Coolify:

1. **Prepare Your CA Certificate**  
   Make sure your certificate is in PEM format.

2. **Upload Your Certificate**  
   Upload your custom CA certificate in the following location:
   ```
   /data/coolify/ssl/coolify-ca.crt
   ```

3. **Mount the Certificate**  
   Make sure that the container that requires database access mounts the certificate at:
   ```
   /data/coolify/ssl/coolify-ca.crt:/etc/ssl/certs/coolify-ca.crt:ro
   ```
