# Cloudflare Tunnels
[Cloudflare Tunnels ↗](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) allow you to securely expose your local server or applications to the internet without opening ports on your router. 

This makes them a great option for hosting projects on devices like old laptops or Raspberry Pis.  


## Why Use Cloudflare Tunnels?
- No need to open or forward ports on your device to the public internet.  
- Simplifies routing and DNS configuration.  
- Supports exposing a single application or multiple services.  
- Hides your server's IP address by routing traffic through a Cloudflare Tunnel, showing only your domain.  
- Works even if you have a dynamic IP (or) no public IP at all.  
- Eliminates the hassle of managing and setting up SSL certificates.  


## When Not to Use Cloudflare Tunnels?
- If you prefer direct access to your server without a proxy layer.  
- If you're concerned about routing traffic through Cloudflare's servers.  
- If you rely on additional firewall tools, as Cloudflare Tunnels bypass all firewall rules.  
- If you need SSL certificates trusted by entities other than Cloudflare.  


## Ways to Use Cloudflare Tunnels with Coolify
You can set up Cloudflare Tunnels with Coolify in several ways, depending on your needs. Below are the available options, each linked to a detailed guide for easy setup:

1. [All Resources](/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels/all-resource) -> Use a tunnel for all resources deployed through Coolify. This is the **easiest** and **most recommended** way for beginners.

2. [Single Resource](/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels/single-resource) -> Use a tunnel for a single resource deployed through Coolify.

3. [Server SSH Access](/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels/server-ssh) -> Securely connect your server to Coolify using a domain through Cloudflare Tunnel.

4. [Full HTTPS/TLS](/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels/full-tls) -> Enable always-on **HTTPS** for all domains and subdomains. Normally, Coolify uses **HTTP** while Cloudflare manages **HTTPS**. If certain apps require **HTTPS** directly on Coolify.

5. [Manual Setup](/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels/manual-setup) -> A detailed, step-by-step guide for manual tunnel configuration. **Only follow this if you know what you are doing.**

::: success Tip:
  It’s highly recommended to go with the first option [All Resources](/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels/all-resource) if you're new to Coolify and Cloudflare Tunnels, as it’s much easier to set up and manage.
