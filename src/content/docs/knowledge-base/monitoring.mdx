Coolify has a built-in monitoring system, which can be used to monitor your resources and send notifications to your team if something goes wrong.

Currently Coolify monitors the following resources:

- Disk usage - If your disk usage is above the configured threshold, it does an automatic cleanup.
- If any of your containers are stopped or restarted.
- Backup status.
