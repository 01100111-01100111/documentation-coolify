Services in Coolify are templates made from normal [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/reference/compose-file/) files + a bit of magic.
See [Coolify's docker-compose specs](/docs/knowledge-base/docker/compose) to learn how to benefit from generated variables and storage handling.

## Metadata

You need to add extra metadata to the top of the `docker-compose` file, like:

- documentation link
- a slogan
- additional tags (for better searching)
- logo (local icon, could be svg, png, etc)
- port (always use the port which is the main entrypoint - like frontend - of the service)

<Aside type="caution">
  Always add a port, because Caddy Proxy cannot determine the port of the
  service automatically.
</Aside>

Example:

```
# documentation: https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/
# slogan: n8n is an extendable workflow automation tool which enables you to connect anything to everything via its open, fair-code model.
# tags: n8n,workflow,automation,open,source,low,code
# logo: svgs/n8n.svg
# port: 5678

... rest of the compose file ...

```

## Add a new service

Official templates stored [here](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/blob/main/templates/compose). They are just normal docker-compose files with a bit of magic.

To add a new service, you can easily test your templates with `Docker Compose` deployments inside Coolify. It uses the same process to parse, generate and deploy as the one-click services.

If you are done with tests and everything works, open a [PR](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/compare), that have the new `<service>.yaml` compose file under `/templates/compose`.

<Aside type="tip">
  Coolify will use a [parsed
  version](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/blob/main/templates/service-templates.json).

### Request a new service

If there is a service template you'd like to see:
1. Search GitHub discussions [here](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/discussions/categories/new-service-integrations).
2. If it has already been requested, upvote it. If not, create a new request.
