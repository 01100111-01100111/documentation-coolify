Coolify uses SSH to connect to your server and deploy your applications. This is true even when using the `localhost` server where Coolify is running.

<Aside type="caution">
  The SSH key must not have a passphrase or 2FA enabled for the root user or the connection will fail.
</Aside>

## Configuration Steps

These are the steps to configure OpenSSH for Coolify. 

<Aside type="tip">
Normally this is done automatically by the Coolify installation script but in case it is not, you can follow these steps.
</Aside>

<Steps>

1. Install and Enable SSH

    Choose the commands for your Linux distribution:

    **Ubuntu/Debian**
    ```bash
    sudo apt install openssh-server
    sudo systemctl status sshd
    ```

    **CentOS/RHEL**
    ```bash
    sudo yum install openssh-server
    sudo systemctl status sshd
    ```

    **Arch Linux**
    ```bash
    sudo pacman -S openssh
    sudo systemctl status sshd
    ```

    **Alpine Linux**
    ```bash
    sudo apk add openssh
    sudo rc-service sshd status
    ```

    **SLES/openSUSE**
    ```bash
    sudo zypper install openssh
    sudo systemctl status sshd
    ```

2. Configure SSH Settings

    Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to ensure these settings:
    ```ssh
    PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
    PubkeyAuthentication yes
    ```
    You can also set `PermitRootLogin` to `yes`, `without-password`, or `prohibit-password` (all of these are supported).
   
    Make sure to restart the SSH service after changing the configuration.


3. Set Up SSH Keys

    If you used the automated Coolify installation script, this step is already done.

    For manual installation:

    ```bash
    # Generate SSH key pair
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 100 \
        -f /data/coolify/ssh/keys/id.root@host.docker.internal \
        -q -N "" -C root@coolify

    # Set correct ownership
    chown 9999 /data/coolify/ssh/keys/id.root@host.docker.internal

    # Add public key to authorized_keys
    cat /data/coolify/ssh/keys/id.root@host.docker.internal.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

    # Set proper permissions
    chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    chmod 700 ~/.ssh
    ```

4. Configure Coolify

    1. Go to `Keys & Tokens` menu
    2. Navigate to `Private Keys` section
    3. Add the private key
    4. Set this key in your localhost server settings

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

If you're having connection issues:
- Verify SSH service is running.
- Check that the right SSH key is set in Coolify.
- Check permissions on ~/.ssh directory and files.
- Ensure the SSH key has no passphrase and no 2FA enabled.
- Confirm you are using the right user.
